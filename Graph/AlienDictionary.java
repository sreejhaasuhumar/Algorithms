    * Alien Dictionary
    * There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you.
    * You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language.
    * Derive the order of letters in this language.
    * Example 1:
    * Input:
    * [
    *   "wrt",
    *   "wrf",
    *   "er",
    *   "ett",
    *   "rftt"
    * ]
    * Output: "wertf"
    * Explanation:
    * From "wrt" and "wrf", we can derive that 't' comes before 'f'.
    * From "wrt" and "er", we can derive that 'w' comes before 'e'.
    * From "er" and "ett", we can derive that 'r' comes before 't'.
    * From "ett" and "rftt", we can derive that 'e' comes before 'r'.
    * Therefore, the correct order is "wertf".
    * Example 2:
    * Input:
    * [
    *   "z",
    *   "x"
    * ]
    * Output: "zx"
    * Example 3:
    * Input:
    * [
    *   "z",
    *   "y"
    * ]
    * Output: "zy"
